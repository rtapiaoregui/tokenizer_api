2) Installation of the package:
    To install the package, please run 
    >> python setup.py build
    from the root directory */tokenizer_api
    
    Once that is done, you should run
    >> python -m pip install .
    which will install the package in your active python environment
    
    You can now import custom_tokenizer (for an example, see usage_example.py)
    

3) Test suite:
    The tests has been developed using pytest. 
    To run the tests, simply execute
    >> python setup.py test
    from the root directory */tokenizer_api
    
    Don't be surprised to find out there are two tests the system is failing.
    This is part of its expected behaviour.
